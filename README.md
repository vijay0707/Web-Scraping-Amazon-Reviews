# Web-Scraping-Amazon-Reviews
### Scraping Amazon product reviews using Python 
The product reviews are scraped using **ASIN Number** and stored as JSON file

Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a ten-digit alphanumeric code that identifies products on Amazon. It’s unique for each product and is assigned when you create a new product in Amazon’s catalog.  Almost every product on Amazon has an ASIN with the exception of books (they use the ISBN or International Standard Book Number in place of an ASIN).
